					<q><span>The biggest study</span> into organic food has found that it is more nutritious than ordinary produce and may help to lengthen people's lives. The evidence from the Â£12m [$20m AUD] four-year project will end years of debate and is likely to overturn government advice that eating organic food is no more than a lifestyle choice.</q>
